## Project Description
In times of COVID pandemic pneumonia is not a rare disease.
It's an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.

To ease the burden on medical professionals, we have created a neural network that can detect pneumonia from x-rays.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects of the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other.

## Goals
Our goal is to achieve a CNN model with a success rate of around 90 percent.

## Workflow
1. Research
2. Collecting the x-rays
3. Coding
4. Testing 
5. Finetuning


## Organization & Tools
1. We used Trello for organizing 
2. We used open source x-ray images from Kaggle
3. Google Collab
